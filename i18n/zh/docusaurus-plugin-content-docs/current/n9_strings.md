# 字符串

## What is a string?
A string is a series of ascii characters joined to create a "sentence".


## Defining Strings

You can define string by using quotation: **"** Your String Here **"**

For example,

```jsx
var animal = "cat"
```
will be a string, while

```jsx
笼子
```
is an object


## Combining strings with a number

Whenever you add string to a number (or vice versa), the end result will be string. The numbers are implicitly converted into strings.
