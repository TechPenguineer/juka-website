# Offline Documentation

There are two ways Juka can be accessed offline: through PDF and through cached Juka website (Juka PWA).

## Cached Website/Juka PWA

### If you are on a mobile device:
Click on "add this to homepage". This will automatically create a PWA app which can be accessed even without the internet.

### If you are on a Desktop (Windows, Macintosh, Linux,ChromeOS):
Find the browser URL field and look at the right section. Click on "Install Juka Programming Language Website". This will install a browser app that can be ran offline (without internet).

## PDF

Juka documentation can be downloaded by going to "Downloads" page and scrolling down to documentation page.

You can also download directly from:
