### Local Deployment

#### Requirements
```
Node.js version >= 14
Yarn v1.5+
```

Run the following command to deploy the server locally:
```
npm run start
```

or

```
npx docusaurus start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
