# Running Online

There are three ways to run Juka without installing anything (and using a 3rd party system):

* **IDE**

The fully featured web-based online IDE. You can either run it [online](https://ide.jukalang.com) through a third party system (or host your own version by installing the app)
* **Lite IDE**

The Juka Try Online is a web-based IDE that allows you to write, compile, and run Juka code without installing anything. To use the Juka Try Online, simply visit the [Juka website](https://jukalang.com/tryonline) and start coding.

* **API**

The Juka API is a RESTful API that allows you to run Juka code on a remote server. To use the Juka API, you will need to create an account and obtain an API key. Once you have an API key, you can use it to run Juka code by making HTTP requests to the Juka API endpoints.
