# Juka API

The Juka API is a powerful tool for developers who want to use the Juka programming language in their applications. With the Juka API, you can:

* Run Juka code on a remote server.
* Integrate Juka code with your existing applications.
* Build custom Juka applications.

The Juka API is still under development, but it is already available for use. To learn more about the Juka API, visit the [Juka website](https://jukalang.com/api/).

### Coming Soon

We are currently working on adding new features to the Juka API, such as:

* Support for more Juka features, such as functions, classes, and objects.
* The ability to debug Juka code.
* The ability to use the Juka API in a variety of programming languages.

We will be sharing more information about these features soon. In the meantime, you can learn more about the Juka API on our discord channel.
