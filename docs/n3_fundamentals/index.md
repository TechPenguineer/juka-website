# Fundamentals of Juka Programming Language

Juka is a general-purpose programming language that is designed to be simple, efficient, and expressive. It is a statically typed language, which means that the types of variables and expressions are checked at compile time. Juka is also a compiled language, which means that it is converted to machine code before it is executed.

## Syntax

The syntax of Juka is similar to that of other programming languages, such as Java and C#. The basic building blocks of Juka code are expressions, statements, and functions.

* **Expressions** are used to evaluate values. They can be composed of variables, literals, operators, and functions.
* **Statements** are used to control the flow of execution. They can be used to assign values to variables, call functions, and make decisions.
* **Functions** are reusable blocks of code. They can be called from other functions or from the main program.
