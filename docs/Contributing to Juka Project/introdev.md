## Coding style

Juka is built on top of .NET, so please follow the coding conventions outlined in the [.NET coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).

## Testing

Testing is an important part of the Juka development process. We encourage you to write tests for your code. Please focus on edge cases when you write tests.
