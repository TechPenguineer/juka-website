# Visitor Pattern

The visitor pattern is a software design pattern that allows a single operation to be applied to the elements of an object structure without changing the structure itself. It is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates.

Juka is built using the visitor pattern. This means that Juka code can be written in a way that is independent of the specific object structure that it is being applied to. This makes Juka code more reusable and easier to maintain.
