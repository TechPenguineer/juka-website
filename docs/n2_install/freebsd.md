# FreeBSD

To install Juka on FreeBSD, run the following command:

```jsx
pkg install juka
```

or download it directly from https://jukalang.com/download

Once Juka is installed, you can start the editor by running the following command:

```jsx
./juka
```


To run Juka code from a file, run the following command, substituting the name of your file for `my_file.juk`:

```jsx
./juka my_file.juk
```

For example, to run the code in the file `hello_world.juk`, you would run the following command:

```jsx
./juka hello_world.juk
```

This will compile and execute the Juka code in the file, and print the output to the console.
